## FAQ

**Q:** **Why this UI style? Just use the terminal?**
**A:** I wanted to be able to see the history of my requests, favorite some requests when I'm working on a specific controller, and see the status of the request on the request's preview before I select it, which postman didn't have and I hated guessing and trying each one to see which one works.

**Q:** **Why self-hosted?**
**A:** I don't want to pay for cloud resources for your convenience. Jokes aside, it's impossible to make API requests to an API that is locally hosted from postwoman if it was hosted on a deployed server (without having a user download something locally), and I plan on using this on APIs I'm building locally.

**Q:** **Why use the name postwoman?**
**A:** I knew I wanted to make a dev tool to replace postman that catered to what I wanted, and the name postwoman popped in my mind, which I knew was funny and stupid. After my girlfriend jokingly made fun of it, I went with it. It doesn't really matter to me that the name is overused. And yes I'm talking to myself, but you're reading it.
